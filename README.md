# node-serverless-function
This repository contains a basic Node.js serverless function that retrieves data from a local JSON file when a GET request is made, and updates the data in the same file when a POST request is made.

The function was created as a personal project to explore backend development using Node.js. It is a simple but effective way to learn how to create a server, handle requests, and manipulate data.
